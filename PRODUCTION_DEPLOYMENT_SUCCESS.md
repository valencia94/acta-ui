## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Frontend Stack

- **React 18** - Modern component-based UI
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **React PDF** - Document preview capability
- **Vite** - Fast build tool with code-splitting

### Backend Stack

- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless functions
- **API Gateway** - RESTful API endpoints
- **DynamoDB** - Project data storage
- **S3 + CloudFront** - Document storage and delivery

### Deployment Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD
- **AWS CLI** - Infrastructure deployment
- **CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as Code (bypassed for manual API wiring)

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### 1. API Gateway Integration Solution

- **Problem**: CloudFormation overwrites manual API integrations
- **Solution**: Bypassed CF API stack deployment, maintained manual wiring
- **Result**: APIs remain stable across deployments

### 2. PDF Preview Feature

- **Implementation**: React-PDF with lazy loading
- **Code Splitting**: Separate chunk for PDF viewer (~410KB gzipped)
- **Performance**: Only loads when needed, reducing initial bundle size

### 3. Deployment Strategy

- **Conflict Prevention**: Disabled competing GitHub Actions
- **Concurrency Control**: Single deployment at a time
- **Testing Integration**: Proactive backend testing in pipeline

### 4. Security & Access

- **Authentication**: Required for all data endpoints
- **CORS**: Properly configured for frontend access
- **OAC**: CloudFront Origin Access Control for S3 security
