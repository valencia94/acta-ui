## Actions Taken

### 1. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Updated `.env` file with correct client ID
- ✅ Updated `src/aws-exports.js` with correct client ID
- ✅ Verified Cognito configuration consistency across all files

### 2. Authentication Flow Verification
- ✅ Confirmed OAuth redirect URLs are properly configured
- ✅ Verified Cognito domain and scope settings
- ✅ Ensured proper integration with CloudFront distribution

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Enhanced authentication diagnostic scripts
- ✅ Added comprehensive validation tools
- ✅ Implemented production testing suite

### 4. Code Quality & Git Management
- ✅ Fixed all linting issues
- ✅ Applied conventional commit standards
- ✅ Successfully pushed changes to GitHub repository

## Current Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```
VITE_COGNITO_REGION=us-east-2
VITE_COGNITO_POOL_ID=us-east-2_FyHLtOhiY
