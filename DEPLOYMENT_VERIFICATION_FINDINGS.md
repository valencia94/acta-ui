# Deployment Verification Findings

## Critical Issues Found

Based on our verification checks, the current deployment is missing several critical components:

1. **Missing API Functions**
   - `getSummary` - Not found in build
   - `getTimeline` - Not found in build
   - `getDownloadUrl` - Not found in build
   - `sendApprovalEmail` - Not found in build

2. **Missing Utility Functions**
   - `fetchWrapper` - Not found in build

3. **Missing AWS Configuration**
   - `aws-exports.js` - Not included in the build directory

These are critical issues that would cause the application to fail in production. The API functions are essential for retrieving project data and generating ACTA documents. Without the fetch wrapper, API calls cannot be made. The AWS exports file is required for connecting to AWS services including Cognito authentication.

## Root Cause

The most likely causes are:

1. **Tree-shaking removing "unused" code** - The build process might be aggressively removing code that it doesn't detect as being directly used.

2. **Missing entry point imports** - The API functions might not be properly imported in components that are included in the final build.

3. **Vite build configuration** - The current Vite configuration might not be correctly handling the `aws-exports.js` file or properly including all necessary code.

## Solution

A comprehensive script (`rebuild-and-deploy-complete.sh`) has been created to address these issues:

1. **Update Vite Configuration**: Modifies `vite.config.ts` to ensure proper handling of assets and prevents over-aggressive tree-shaking

2. **Fix AWS Exports Handling**: Creates copies of `aws-exports.js` in both the build output and the public directory

3. **Ensure API Functions are Included**: Creates an index file that re-exports all API functions and adds an import to the main entry file

4. **Full Rebuild and Deploy**: Cleans the previous build, rebuilds with the new configuration, and deploys to S3

5. **CloudFront Cache Invalidation**: Ensures the latest changes are immediately available

## How to Deploy a Complete Build

1. **Set required environment variables:**

   ```bash
   export AWS_REGION=us-east-2
   export S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
   export CLOUDFRONT_DIST_ID=your-cloudfront-distribution-id
   ```

2. **Run the rebuild and deploy script:**

   ```bash
   ./rebuild-and-deploy-complete.sh
   ```

3. **Verify the deployment:**

   ```bash
   node test-production.js
   ```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Add explicit imports** - Add explicit imports for all API functions in the main application components to prevent tree-shaking from removing them.

2. **Create a comprehensive test suite** - Implement automated tests that verify all critical functionality.

3. **Add build validation** - Add a build step that validates the presence of critical files before deployment.

4. **Document critical components** - Create documentation that lists all critical components that must be included in every build.

5. **Use bundle analysis tools** - Regularly analyze the bundle to ensure all necessary code is included.

By following these recommendations, we can ensure that future deployments include all critical components and avoid similar issues.
