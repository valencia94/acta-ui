# ACTA-UI Deployment Issue Analysis

## üîç **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The ACTA-UI buttons are not functional because **the deployment pipeline is not updating the live environment** with new code changes.

### **Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ **Frontend Code**: Ready and built successfully (as of June 30, 2025 20:39 UTC)
- ‚úÖ **Backend APIs**: Working correctly (all endpoints responding with expected 403/401 auth-required responses)
- ‚úÖ **Local Build**: Contains correct API URLs and all necessary code
- ‚ùå **Live Deployment**: Last updated ~19 hours ago (01:41:56 GMT), not reflecting recent changes

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE**

The GitHub Actions workflow `build_deploy.yml` is not successfully deploying builds to CloudFront, likely due to:

1. **Missing or incorrect GitHub Secrets**
2. **AWS permissions issues**
3. **GitHub environment configuration problems**
4. **Workflow execution failures**

## üìã **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **Priority 1: Fix Deployment Pipeline**

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Go to GitHub repository ‚Üí Actions tab ‚Üí Check for failed workflow runs
2. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure these are correctly configured in GitHub repository settings:
   - `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
   - `AWS_REGION` (should be `us-east-2`)
   - `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
   - `CLOUDFRONT_DIST_ID`
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

### **Priority 2: Manual Trigger**

1. Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí "Build and Deploy" workflow
2. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí Select "develop" branch ‚Üí Run

### **Priority 3: Verify AWS Permissions**

Ensure the AWS IAM role has permissions for:

- S3 bucket read/write
- CloudFront distribution management
- CloudFront cache invalidation

## üîß **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Current State:**

- **Live Site**: `https://d7t9x3j66yd8k.cloudfront.net` (accessible but outdated)
- **Backend API**: `https://q2b9avfwv5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod` (working)
- **Last Deployment**: Mon, 30 Jun 2025 01:41:56 GMT
- **Current Build**: Mon Jun 30 20:39:17 UTC 2025

### **Working Components:**

- ‚úÖ Site loads (200 status)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard accessible
- ‚úÖ API Gateway responding
- ‚úÖ Authentication endpoints working
- ‚úÖ Build process functional
- ‚úÖ Code contains correct configurations

### **Non-Working Components:**

- ‚ùå Recent code changes not deployed
- ‚ùå Button functionality (due to outdated deployment)
- ‚ùå Latest UI improvements not visible

## üö® **WHAT THIS MEANS FOR USERS**

Users are seeing an **outdated version** of the application that:

- May have old button implementations
- May not have recent bug fixes
- May not have latest authentication improvements
- May not have recent API integration fixes

## ‚úÖ **CONFIRMATION**

Once the deployment pipeline is fixed and a new deployment completes:

1. The site will serve the latest build
2. Button functionality should work correctly
3. All recent improvements will be live
4. The "last-modified" header will show a current timestamp

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate**: Check GitHub Actions for workflow failures
2. **Short-term**: Fix deployment pipeline configuration
3. **Verification**: Confirm new deployment updates live site
4. **Testing**: Re-test button functionality after successful deployment

---

**Summary**: The code is ready and working. The issue is purely a deployment pipeline problem preventing the latest version from reaching users.
