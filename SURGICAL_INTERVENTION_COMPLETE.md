# 🏥 Surgical Intervention Complete - Acta-UI Production CORS Fix

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

Following AWS Architect best practices, we implemented a **surgical intervention** on the live production deployment with proper separation by control plane:

### 1️⃣ API Gateway CORS Fix (Control Plane: API Gateway)
- **Script**: `surgical-apigateway-cors-fix.sh`
- **Target**: REST API `q2b9avfwv5` in `us-east-2`
- **Actions**:
  - Fixed OPTIONS methods for all critical endpoints
  - Added proper CORS headers for CloudFront origin: `https://d7t9x3j66yd8k.cloudfront.net`
  - Added `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` for Cognito authentication
  - Deployed changes to `prod` stage

### 2️⃣ CloudFront Origin Request Policy Fix (Control Plane: CloudFront)
- **Script**: `surgical-cloudfront-fix.sh`
- **Target**: Distribution `EPQU7PVDLQXUA`
- **Actions**:
  - Created custom origin request policy: `acta-ui-auth-headers-policy`
  - Configured header forwarding: `Authorization`, `Origin`, `Content-Type`
  - Updated distribution configuration
  - Maintains cache behavior and compression settings

### 3️⃣ Verification & Testing (Control Plane: Monitoring)
- **Script**: `surgical-verification.sh`
- **Tests**:
  - API Gateway CORS headers
  - CloudFront distribution status
  - Production app load
  - Backend health checks

## 🎯 Fixed Issues

### ❌ Before (CORS Errors)
```
Access to fetch at 'https://q2b9avfwv5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/health' 
from origin 'https://d7t9x3j66yd8k.cloudfront.net' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

### ✅ After (Working Authentication & API Calls)
- ✅ Cognito authentication works in production
- ✅ Admin dashboard loads without errors
- ✅ All API calls from dashboard work correctly
- ✅ CORS headers properly configured
- ✅ Auth headers forwarded through CloudFront

## 📋 Key Endpoints Fixed

All critical Acta-UI API endpoints now have proper CORS:
- `/health` - Health check
- `/pm-manager/{pmEmail}` - Projects by PM
- `/pm-manager/all-projects` - All projects (admin)
- `/projects` - General projects endpoint
- `/extract-project-place/{projectId}` - Project data extraction
- `/document-validator/{id}` - Document validation
- `/project-summary/{id}` - Project summaries
- `/timeline/{id}` - Project timelines
- `/download-acta/{id}` - Document downloads
- `/send-approval-email` - Email functionality
- `/bulk-generate-summaries` - Bulk operations

## 🔒 Security Maintained

- ✅ Cognito authentication still required
- ✅ Only CloudFront origin allowed in CORS
- ✅ No unnecessary headers exposed
- ✅ Credentials properly handled

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Production App Test:
1. **Load Test**: ✅ App loads at `https://d7t9x3j66yd8k.cloudfront.net`
2. **Authentication**: ✅ Cognito login form appears (no client errors)
3. **Dashboard Access**: ✅ Admin dashboard accessible
4. **API Calls**: ✅ Backend diagnostic and health checks work
5. **CORS Headers**: ✅ Proper headers returned for all endpoints

### Browser Console (No Errors):
- ✅ No Cognito "User pool client does not exist" errors
- ✅ No CORS policy blocking errors
- ✅ All API endpoints return proper headers

## 📊 Production Metrics

### Infrastructure Status:
- **API Gateway**: ✅ Deployed with CORS headers
- **CloudFront**: ✅ Updated with header forwarding policy
- **S3 Frontend**: ✅ Latest build with correct config
- **Cognito**: ✅ Properly configured client ID
- **Health Check**: ✅ Backend responding normally

### Deployment IDs:
- **API Gateway Deployment**: Latest with CORS fixes
- **CloudFront Policy**: `acta-ui-auth-headers-policy` 
- **Frontend Build**: Contains correct Cognito client `dshos5iou44tuach7ta3ici5m`

## 🎉 Surgical Intervention: SUCCESS

The production Acta-UI application is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Working Cognito authentication
- ✅ Proper CORS configuration 
- ✅ Admin dashboard functionality
- ✅ All API endpoints accessible
- ✅ Zero authentication or CORS errors

**Ready for production use!** 🚀
