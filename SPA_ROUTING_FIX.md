# SPA Routing Fix Documentation

## Problem
The Acta UI was experiencing routing issues where:
- Direct navigation to routes like `/dashboard` or `/projects-for-pm` returned 404 errors
- Browser refresh on any route except `/login` failed
- Only the login screen was accessible via direct links

## Root Cause
This is a common Single Page Application (SPA) routing issue where:
1. React Router handles routing client-side
2. Server/CDN doesn't know about client-side routes
3. Direct requests to `/dashboard` try to find a file that doesn't exist
4. No fallback mechanism to serve `index.html` for all routes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Added `base: "/"` for proper base path
- Added `historyApiFallback: true` for dev/preview servers
- Automated creation of `404.html` from `index.html` during build

### 2. Build Process Enhancement
- Modified Vite plugin to copy `index.html` to `404.html` automatically
- Added post-build smoke test validation
- Updated deployment script with verification steps

### 3. React Router Configuration (`App.tsx`)
- Confirmed BrowserRouter is properly configured
- Added `/projects-for-pm` route as mentioned in requirements
- Added catch-all route (`*`) for unmatched paths
- Added development route logging

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Created `scripts/smoke-test.js` for build validation
- Created `scripts/test-spa-config.js` for configuration testing
- Added verification steps to deployment process

## How It Works

### Development
- Vite dev server with `historyApiFallback: true` serves `index.html` for all routes
- Route logging in dev mode shows available routes in console

### Production
1. Build creates `dist/index.html` with bundled assets
2. Vite plugin automatically copies `index.html` to `404.html`
3. Smoke test validates both files exist and are identical
4. S3 deployment uploads both files
5. CloudFront serves `404.html` (which is identical to `index.html`) for unknown routes
6. React Router takes over and renders the correct component

### CloudFront/S3 Behavior
- Known files (JS, CSS, images) serve normally
- Unknown paths (like `/dashboard`) trigger 404 error
- S3 serves `404.html` for 404 errors
- `404.html` contains the full React app, which boots and handles routing

## Routes Available
- `/` - Redirects to `/dashboard` if authenticated, `/login` if not
- `/login` - Login page
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/admin` - Admin panel
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/projects-for-pm` - Project Manager view
- `/*` - Catch-all redirects to appropriate page

## Testing
```bash
# Test configuration
npm run test:spa-config

# Test build output (after build)
npm run smoke-test

# Full deployment with tests
npm run deploy
```

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for CloudFront cache invalidation
2. Test direct navigation: `https://your-domain.com/dashboard`
3. Test browser refresh on different routes
4. Verify all routes load the React app correctly
