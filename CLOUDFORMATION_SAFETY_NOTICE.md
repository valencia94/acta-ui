# ⚠️ CRITICAL: CloudFormation Deployment Safety Notice

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Backend Already Manually Configured

The backend infrastructure has been **manually configured** and is working correctly. 

### ❌ **DISABLED WORKFLOWS** (to prevent destroying manual work):
- `deploy-simplified-backend.yml.DISABLED`
- `build_deploy_with_backend.yml.DISABLED`

### ✅ **SAFE WORKFLOW** (frontend-only deployment):
- `build_deploy.yml` - Frontend deployment only, skips CloudFormation

## 🛡️ Why This Matters:

Yesterday's deployment issues were caused by automated CloudFormation stacks overwriting manual backend configurations. The current manual setup includes:

- ✅ API Gateway resources manually created
- ✅ Lambda functions properly integrated  
- ✅ CORS policies correctly configured
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ All endpoints tested and functional

## 🚀 Current Safe Deployment Strategy:

1. **Frontend Only**: Deploy React app to S3/CloudFront
2. **Backend Preserved**: Keep existing manual API Gateway setup
3. **No CloudFormation**: Avoid stack deployments that could break working backend
4. **Testing First**: Always verify endpoints before any changes

## 📋 Working Endpoints (Manual):
- `/timeline/{projectId}` ✅
- `/project-summary/{projectId}` ✅  
- `/download-acta/{projectId}` ✅
- `/extract-project-place/{projectId}` ✅
- `/send-approval-email` ✅
- `/pm-manager/all-projects` ✅
- `/pm-manager/{pmEmail}` ✅

**Status**: Backend infrastructure is stable and should NOT be modified by automation.
