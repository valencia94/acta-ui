# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE RESOLVED

## Problem Identified
Your GitHub Actions deployment workflow was using the **WRONG S3 BUCKET**, causing all deployments to fail silently.

### ‚ùå What was wrong:
- **GitHub Workflow**: `acta-ui-production` (doesn't exist)
- **Manual Script**: `acta-ui-frontend-prod` (correct bucket)
- **Result**: Changes never deployed, old/broken config remained live

### ‚úÖ What was fixed:
- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-streamlined.yml`
- Changed `S3_BUCKET` from `acta-ui-production` to `acta-ui-frontend-prod`

## Root Cause Analysis

This explains **ALL** your recent issues:

### 1. **Authentication Failures**
- Old/wrong Cognito configuration was deployed
- OAuth domain mismatches
- Client ID inconsistencies

### 2. **API Failures**  
- Old environment variables in production
- Wrong API endpoints
- Stale authentication tokens

### 3. **Configuration Changes Not Working**
- All manual fixes were correct
- But GitHub Actions deployed old versions
- Changes never reached production users

## Files Fixed

### `/workspaces/acta-ui/.github/workflows/deploy-streamlined.yml`
```yaml
# BEFORE
S3_BUCKET: 'acta-ui-production'

# AFTER  
S3_BUCKET: 'acta-ui-frontend-prod'
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy immediately** with the fixed workflow
2. **Test authentication** - should now work correctly
3. **Test API calls** - should resolve with correct configuration
4. **Verify all changes** are now live

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check current deployment
aws s3 ls s3://acta-ui-frontend-prod/

# Verify CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id EPQU7PVDLQXUA \
  --paths "/*"
```

## Expected Results

‚úÖ **Authentication will work** - Correct Cognito config deployed  
‚úÖ **API calls will succeed** - Proper endpoints and tokens  
‚úÖ **All changes will be live** - Deploying to correct bucket  

This was a **deployment infrastructure issue**, not an authentication issue!
