# 🚀 ACTA-UI Deployment Progress & Monitoring Tools

This document describes the comprehensive deployment monitoring and testing suite created for ACTA-UI's simplified Lambda-centric backend architecture.

## 📋 Available Tools

### 🎯 **Main Management Interface**
```bash
./deploy-manage.sh [command]
```
**Unified interface for all deployment operations:**
- `test-pre` - Run pre-deployment validation
- `test-post` - Run post-deployment endpoint tests
- `check` - Quick deployment status check
- `monitor` - Full deployment monitoring
- `watch` - Continuous monitoring (refreshes every 30s)
- `deploy` - Local deployment via AWS CLI
- `logs` - Show recent deployment activity
- `endpoints` - List all API endpoints
- `help` - Show usage information

### 🧪 **Testing Scripts**

#### **Pre-Deployment Testing**
```bash
./test-backend-proactive.sh
```
**Validates deployment readiness:**
- ✅ CloudFormation template syntax and structure
- ✅ Required parameters and resources
- ✅ Lambda permissions configuration
- ✅ Security and integration settings
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows
- ✅ Git repository status

#### **Post-Deployment Testing**
```bash
./test-backend-postdeploy.sh [api-id] [region] [stage]
```
**Comprehensive endpoint validation:**
- ✅ PM Projects endpoints functionality
- ✅ Document status endpoints
- ✅ Performance consistency testing
- ✅ Error handling validation
- ✅ CORS headers verification
- ✅ Response time measurement

### 📊 **Monitoring Scripts**

#### **Full Deployment Monitor**
```bash
./monitor-deployment-progress.sh [--watch]
```
**Comprehensive deployment tracking:**
- 🔍 GitHub Actions workflow status
- 🔍 CloudFormation stack status and events
- 🔍 API Gateway endpoint health
- 🔍 Frontend deployment status
- 🔗 Helpful links to AWS Console and GitHub
- 📋 Next steps and troubleshooting guidance

#### **Quick Status Check**
```bash
./quick-deploy-check.sh
```
**Rapid deployment status overview:**
- ⚡ CloudFormation stack status
- ⚡ Critical endpoint health checks
- ⚡ Quick action recommendations
- ⚡ Exit codes for scripting integration

## 🎯 **Deployment Workflow Integration**

### **GitHub Actions Integration**
The tools are integrated into your GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Pre-Deployment Testing**: Runs `test-backend-proactive.sh` before deployment
2. **Post-Deployment Testing**: Runs `test-backend-postdeploy.sh` after deployment
3. **Automated Validation**: Catches issues early in the CI/CD pipeline

### **Local Development Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment validation
./deploy-manage.sh test-pre

# 2. Deploy locally (if needed)
./deploy-manage.sh deploy

# 3. Monitor deployment progress
./deploy-manage.sh watch

# 4. Quick status checks
./deploy-manage.sh check

# 5. Post-deployment testing
./deploy-manage.sh test-post

# 6. List available endpoints
./deploy-manage.sh endpoints
```

## 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard**

### **Real-time Status**
```bash
# Continuous monitoring (refreshes every 30s)
./deploy-manage.sh watch

# OR using system watch command
watch -n 30 ./deploy-manage.sh check
```

### **Key Indicators**
- **🟢 Green**: Successful deployment/operation
- **🟡 Yellow**: In progress or auth required (expected)
- **🔴 Red**: Failed or error state
- **🔵 Blue**: Informational status

## 🔗 **Integration Points**

### **GitHub Actions**
- Monitors: `https://github.com/valencia94/acta-ui/actions`
- Triggers on push to `develop` branch
- Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`

### **AWS Console Links**
- **CloudFormation**: Stack `acta-simplified-backend` in `us-east-2`
- **API Gateway**: ID `q2b9avfwv5` in `us-east-2`
- **Lambda Functions**: Region `us-east-2`

### **API Endpoints**
**Base URL**: `https://q2b9avfwv5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod`

**New PM/Admin Endpoints** (routed to `projectMetadataEnricher`):
- `GET /pm-projects/all-projects`
- `GET /pm-projects/{pmEmail}`
- `GET /projects`
- `GET /check-document/{projectId}`
- `HEAD /check-document/{projectId}`

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **CloudFormation Stack Not Found**
```bash
# Check if deployment is running
./deploy-manage.sh monitor

# Deploy locally if needed
./deploy-manage.sh deploy
```

#### **403 Auth Required (Expected)**
- ✅ **This is normal** for PM endpoints
- Indicates endpoints exist and Lambda is responding
- Authentication will be handled by your frontend

#### **404 Not Found**
- ❌ Endpoint not created or deployment failed
- Check CloudFormation stack events
- Re-run deployment

#### **Deployment Monitoring**
```bash
# Watch deployment in real-time
./deploy-manage.sh watch

# Check specific status
./deploy-manage.sh check

# View deployment history
./deploy-manage.sh logs
```

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**

The monitoring tools track:
- **Response Times**: Typical 88-199ms for API endpoints
- **Success Rates**: Tracks consistency across multiple requests
- **Error Rates**: Monitors for 4xx/5xx errors
- **Deployment Duration**: CloudFormation stack deployment time

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Always run pre-tests** before deployment
2. **Monitor continuously** during deployment
3. **Validate endpoints** after deployment
4. **Check logs** if issues occur
5. **Use quick-check** for rapid status updates

## 🔄 **Continuous Integration**

Your deployment pipeline now includes:
- ✅ **Proactive Testing**: Prevents deployment issues
- ✅ **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions triggered on push
- ✅ **Post-Deployment Validation**: Confirms successful deployment
- ✅ **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking
- ✅ **Error Detection**: Early warning of issues

This comprehensive suite ensures reliable, observable, and maintainable deployments for your ACTA-UI simplified backend architecture! 🎉
