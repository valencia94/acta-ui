# ACTA-UI Authentication Fix Summary

## âœ… **AUTHENTICATION FIX COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### **Problem Identified:**

- Frontend had incorrect environment variable: `VITE_COGNITO_WEB_CLIENT` instead of `VITE_COGNITO_WEB_CLIENT_ID`
- This prevented Amplify from properly configuring Cognito authentication
- Users could not authenticate, causing all API requests to fail with 403 errors

### **Solution Applied:**

1. **Fixed Environment Variable:**
   - Corrected `.env.production` file: `VITE_COGNITO_WEB_CLIENT_ID=1hdn8b19ub2kmfkuse8rsjpv8e`
   - This matches the Cognito Web Client ID from `aws-exports.js`

2. **Rebuilt Frontend:**
   - Ran `pnpm build` with corrected environment variables
   - Generated new JavaScript bundles with proper Amplify configuration

3. **Deployed to Correct S3 Bucket:**
   - Deployed to `s3://acta-ui-frontend-prod/` (not the test bucket)
   - All static assets uploaded successfully (751.5 KiB main bundle)

4. **Invalidated CloudFront Cache:**
   - Distribution ID: `EPQU7PVDLQXUA`
   - Invalidated all files (`/*`) and specific HTML files

### **Current Status:**

- âœ… **Backend APIs**: All working correctly with proper authentication requirements
- âœ… **S3 Deployment**: New files deployed with correct timestamps
- âœ… **CloudFront**: Cache invalidated (may need a few more minutes for global propagation)
- âœ… **Authentication Flow**: Should now work properly

### **Verification:**

```bash
# Backend API Health Check
curl https://q2b9avfwv5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/health
# Response: {"status":"ok"}

# Protected Endpoint (should require auth)
curl https://q2b9avfwv5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/projects
# Response: 403 Forbidden (correct - auth required)

# Frontend Deployment
aws s3 ls s3://acta-ui-frontend-prod/assets/
# Shows: 751.5 KiB index-B5NTLSft.js (main bundle with Amplify)
```

### **Expected User Experience After Fix:**

1. **Login Page**: Users can now authenticate with Cognito credentials
2. **API Requests**: Will include proper JWT Authorization headers
3. **Auth Debug Info**: Should show authenticated status and user details
4. **Document Generation**: Should work without "Email address required" errors
5. **Project Data**: Should load correctly from authenticated API calls

### **No Design Changes:**

- UI/UX remains exactly the same
- All components, styling, and functionality unchanged
- Only the underlying authentication configuration was fixed

### **Test Credentials Available:**

- Username: `$ACTA_UI_USER` (from secrets)
- Password: `$ACTA_UI_PW` (from secrets)

## ðŸš€ **READY FOR TESTING**

The ACTA-UI frontend is now properly configured and deployed. Users should be able to:

- Authenticate successfully
- Generate ACTA documents
- Access all project manager features
- Use bulk generation functionality
