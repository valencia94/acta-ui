# SPA Routing Fix Summary - July 1st, 2025

## Problem Identified

The ACTA UI dashboard was showing a **black screen** for users due to a **CloudFront SPA (Single Page Application) routing configuration issue**.

### Root Cause

- CloudFront was returning **403 Forbidden** status codes for client-side routes like `/dashboard`, `/admin`, and `/profile`
- This prevented React Router from properly handling client-side navigation
- Users visiting these routes directly (or refreshing the page) would get a black screen instead of the React application

### Diagnostic Results

**Before Fix:**

- `/dashboard` → 403 Forbidden ❌
- `/admin` → 403 Forbidden ❌
- `/profile` → 403 Forbidden ❌

**After Fix:**

- `/dashboard` → 200 OK ✅
- `/admin` → 200 OK ✅
- `/profile` → 200 OK ✅

## Solution Applied

### CloudFront Custom Error Pages Configuration

Updated CloudFront distribution `EPQU7PVDLQXUA` with custom error responses:

```json
"CustomErrorResponses": {
    "Quantity": 2,
    "Items": [
        {
            "ErrorCode": 403,
            "ResponsePagePath": "/index.html",
            "ResponseCode": "200",
            "ErrorCachingMinTTL": 10
        },
        {
            "ErrorCode": 404,
            "ResponsePagePath": "/index.html",
            "ResponseCode": "200",
            "ErrorCachingMinTTL": 10
        }
    ]
}
```

### How It Works

1. When a user visits `/dashboard` directly, S3 returns a 403 (file doesn't exist)
2. CloudFront intercepts the 403 error
3. CloudFront serves `/index.html` instead with a 200 status code
4. React application loads and React Router handles the `/dashboard` route client-side
5. Dashboard renders properly instead of showing a black screen

## Verification

- ✅ All SPA routes now return 200 status codes
- ✅ CloudFront deployment completed successfully
- ✅ Comprehensive diagnostic script confirms fix
- ✅ React application can now handle all client-side routes

## Technical Details

- **Distribution ID:** EPQU7PVDLQXUA
- **CloudFront URL:** https://d7t9x3j66yd8k.cloudfront.net
- **ETag Before:** E3PUO5L9GABDOO
- **ETag After:** E3PE6UC6FS9K5O
- **Status:** Deployed
- **Cache TTL for errors:** 10 seconds (to prevent caching of routing errors)

## Impact

This fix resolves the black screen issue users were experiencing when:

- Navigating directly to `/dashboard`, `/admin`, or `/profile` URLs
- Refreshing the page while on these routes
- Sharing/bookmarking these routes

The ACTA UI application should now work correctly for all users across all routes.

## Files Modified

- `fix-cloudfront-spa-routing.sh` - Script to apply the fix
- `comprehensive-dashboard-diagnostic.sh` - Diagnostic script used to identify and verify the fix

## Next Steps

- Monitor CloudFront access logs for any remaining routing issues
- Consider implementing more comprehensive error handling in the React application
- Update documentation to include SPA routing requirements for future deployments
